# TeenyURL Backend

A URL shortening API, which provides short aliases for redirection of long URLs.

> **Note:** This is just a fun project I wanted to build. It's not meant to be more than that.

**It's purpose:**

* Create short URLs from long ones.
* URLs with expiry dates (Future addon)
* Statistics e.g hits on URL and location (Future addon)
